# 👋 Hi, I'm Shahid Yousuf

**Senior Software Engineer | Backend Architect | Distributed Systems Enthusiast**

I'm a Senior Software Engineer with extensive experience building production-grade backend systems and distributed applications. I specialize in distributed systems architecture, observability solutions, and domain-driven design, with a strong focus on scalability, performance, and maintainability.

I design and implement robust backend systems, modular monoliths, and comprehensive observability solutions. My approach combines architectural thinking with hands-on implementation, always prioritizing clean code, solid design patterns, and continuous learning.

Based in **Srinagar, Kashmir** 🇮🇳 | Passionate about building scalable systems and exploring new technologies
